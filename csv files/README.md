#  Interview Tasks 

 1- I did use different files for my attempts till i got the right solution. The test files are left in here to check my commits.

 2- The error log file has an error when opened on MAc { "Warning: fopen(override_log_file.txt): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/Interview-Task/g/index.php on line 64"}
This is due to user permission hence i did move on a windows operating system  where it works perfectly reason the index file has no commit as it was copied from the windows system.

3- To view the commits of the index file, please go through the test.php files

4- If you are using a mac, do create an error_log_file.txt manually and give permission on your terminal to write the file: chmod 777 error_log_file.txt
